# MapHub
A 3D mapping solution using drones and image capturing
(just a little project we're doing for the robotics team we're on) 

The Maphub is built for archeologists to have an easier time with the first part of their job, figuring out what is actually there. This is NOT a working prototype, just a thing to look cool for our project. we will try our best to make a working protottype if we move on, but that is not now. If you somehow stumble across this, why? Whatever you were looking for, it is not this. Thank you, goodbye. -Grumpy Person

Note from a less grumpy person:
(How our system would work if we prototyped it)
A 3D mapping solution using drones and image capturing.
This is a system tailored towards archeologists that uses camera drones and photogrammetry.
The drone is preferebly the DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise but any camera drone compatible with DJI Cloud API (Application Programming Interface) works.
The photogrammetry software is Meshroom (AliceVision) as it is open source and downloadable. It can take a long time to download.
We if our project/competition goes well we might create a prototype. -Less Grumpy Person
