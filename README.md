# MapHub
A 3D mapping solution using drones and image capturing
(just a little project we're doing for the robotics team we're on) 

The Maphub is built for archeologists to have an easier time with the first part of their job, figuring out what is actually there. This is NOT a working prototype, just a thing to look cool for our project. we will try our best to make a working protottype if we move on, but that is not now. If you somehow stumble across this, why? Whatever you were looking for, it is not this. Thank you, goodbye.
